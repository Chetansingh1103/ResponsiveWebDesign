            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"><br>The goals of water conservation efforts include:<br><br>

                Ensuring the availability of water for future generations where the withdrawal of freshwater from an
                ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
                Energy Conservation as water pumping, delivery, and wastewater treatment facilities consume a
                significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world, over 15% of the total electricity
                consumption is devoted to water management.
                Habitat conservation where minimizing human water usage helps to preserve freshwater habitats for local
                wildlife and migrating waterfowl, but also water quality.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"><br>Water conservation includes all the policies, strategies and
                activities
                to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, to protect the hydrosphere, and to meet the
                current and future human demand (thus avoiding water scarcity). Population, household size and growth
                and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change have increased pressures
                on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation.[1] Many countries
                have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success.[2] The key activities
                to conserve water are as follows: any beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources,[3]
                avoiding any damage to water quality; and improving water management practices that reduce the use or
                enhance the beneficial use of water.[4][5] Technology solutions exist for households, commercial and
                agricultural applications. Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically
                initiated at the local level, by either municipal water utilities or regional governments. Common
                strategies include public outreach campaigns,[6] tiered water rates (charging progressively higher
                prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car
                washing.</p>
